### **Release Engineering Principles**

1. **Reproducible Builds**: Builds should produce the same output given the same inputs, ensuring reliability across environments.
2. **Automated Builds**: Build processes should be fully automated, generating artifacts consistently.
3. **Automated Tests**: Automated test suites validate builds before deployment, ensuring functionality and stability.
4. **Automated Deployments**: Deployment should be executed without manual intervention to reduce human error.
5. **Small Deployments**: Smaller changes are easier to troubleshoot and roll back.

### **Balancing Release Velocity and Reliability**
- Release velocity and reliability are often seen as opposing forces, but they can coexist.
- Using **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** and error budgets ensures that rapid deployments don't compromise reliability.

---

### **What Is Canarying?**
- **Definition**: Canarying involves deploying changes to a small subset of users or systems and monitoring for issues before a full rollout. It functions like an A/B test: the "canary" (new version) is compared against the "control" (existing version).
- This technique mitigates risks by limiting exposure of defective changes to a smaller audience.

### **Release Engineering and Canarying**

#### **Requirements of a Canary Process**
- Ability to deploy to a subset of users or systems.
- Robust evaluation of whether the change is "good" or "bad."
- Seamless integration into the release pipeline.
- Example: Using Google App Engine to deploy both live and candidate versions for side-by-side comparison.

#### **Roll Forward Deployment vs. Simple Canary Deployment**

- **Roll Forward**: Deploying entirely without a safety net, which can lead to extended outages if defects arise.
- **Canary Deployment**: Deploying to a small fraction of users allows rapid detection of issues with minimal impact.

### **Canary Implementation**

#### **Minimizing Risk to SLOs and the Error Budget**
- Small canary deployments minimize potential impact, preserving the error budget. For instance, deploying to 5% of traffic limits errors to 1% overall, assuming 20% of canary requests fail.

#### **Choosing a Canary Population and Duration**
- Factors include:
  - **Size and Duration**: Must be sufficient for statistically significant results.
  - **Traffic Volume**: Ensures diverse and representative inputs.
  - **Time of Day**: Deploy during peak times to stress-test under realistic conditions.

### **Selecting and Evaluating Metrics**

1. **Metrics Should Indicate Problems**: Choose metrics that align with **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**, such as HTTP error rates or response latency.
2. **Metrics Should Be Representative and Attributable**: Metrics must clearly correlate with the change being tested.
3. **Before/After Evaluation Is Risky**: Comparing pre- and post-deployment can introduce noise due to external factors like time-based traffic patterns.
4. **Use Gradual Canaries for Better Metrics**: Gradual scaling of canary populations allows for refined metric evaluation.

---

### **Dependencies and Isolation**
- Imperfect isolation between canary and control environments can affect results. For example:
  - Shared infrastructure like databases might skew metrics.
  - Overlapping traffic between canary and control populations can create confounding variables.

---

### **Canarying in Noninteractive Systems**
- **Challenges**: Noninteractive systems like batch pipelines require adjustments, such as ensuring that canary duration covers complete processing cycles.
- **Metrics**: Include end-to-end processing time and quality metrics specific to the application.

---

### **Requirements on Monitoring Data**
- Monitoring systems must support fine-grained breakdowns to distinguish canary from control metrics. Aggregated metrics with mismatched time intervals can obscure issues.

---

### **Related Concepts**

1. **Blue/Green Deployment**: Maintain parallel environments (e.g., "blue" for live and "green" for staging). Switching traffic between environments enables quick rollbacks but doubles resource requirements.
2. **Artificial Load Generation**: Simulated load helps identify issues but may fail to replicate organic traffic patterns.
3. **Traffic Teeing**: Duplicates live traffic to both production and test environments for analysis without affecting real users.

### **Conclusion**
Canarying provides a robust mechanism for balancing rapid release cycles with system reliability. By combining small, incremental rollouts with effective metric evaluation and isolation strategies, teams can minimize risk and maintain high service availability.

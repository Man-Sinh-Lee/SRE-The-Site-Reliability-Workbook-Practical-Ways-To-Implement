### Chapter 18: SRE Engagement Model

#### **The Service Lifecycle**
1. **Phase 1: Architecture and Design**
   - SREs provide early feedback on system designs, focusing on scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency. Early involvement ensures alignment with production standards.
   
2. **Phase 2: Active Development**
   - Developers and SREs collaborate on defining metrics and deploying initial monitoring systems. Production readiness reviews (PRRs) are initiated during this phase.

3. **Phase 3: Limited Availability**
   - Services are deployed to a subset of users to gather operational data. SREs help manage the rollout and adjust systems based on real-world feedback.

4. **Phase 4: General Availability**
   - The service is made fully available. SREs focus on maintaining reliability while assisting in scaling to handle the full user base.

5. **Phase 5: Deprecation**
   - When transitioning to a replacement system, SREs minimize disruption by supporting the transition and operating the existing system in a scaled-back capacity.

6. **Phase 6: Abandoned**
   - Operational responsibilities transfer to developers. SREs only handle critical incidents on a best-effort basis.

7. **Phase 7: Unsupported**
   - The system is fully decommissioned, with SREs aiding in removing residual configurations and documentation.

#### **Setting Up the Relationship**
1. **Communicating Business and Production Priorities**:
   - Clear communication ensures that SRE and development teams align their efforts with organizational goals and user needs.

2. **Identifying Risks**:
   - SREs proactively highlight potential risks and assess their impact on service reliability, helping prioritize mitigation efforts.

3. **Aligning Goals**:
   - Both teams balance reliability and velocity, using shared objectives like SLOs and error budgets.

4. **Setting Ground Rules**:
   - Defined rules, such as operational limits and error budgets, streamline collaboration and clarify expectations.

5. **Planning and Executing**:
   - Joint planning ensures that roadmaps and milestones are aligned with long-term goals and immediate priorities.

#### **Sustaining an Effective Ongoing Relationship**
1. **Investing Time in Collaboration**:
   - Regular meetings and inter-team events foster trust and improve communication.

2. **Maintaining Open Communication**:
   - Quarterly updates between SRE and development teams ensure both stay aligned on progress and challenges.

3. **Performing Regular Service Reviews**:
   - Periodic reviews identify areas for improvement and celebrate successes, enhancing long-term collaboration.

4. **Adjusting Priorities with SLOs and Error Budgets**:
   - Proactively address potential SLO breaches or use spare error budgets to accelerate feature delivery.

#### **Scaling SRE to Larger Environments**
1. **Supporting Multiple Services with a Single SRE Team**:
   - A single SRE team can manage multiple services if they share similar technologies and business goals.

2. **Structuring a Multiple SRE Team Environment**:
   - Teams can be grouped by product or technology stack to minimize overhead and improve focus.

3. **Adapting to Changing Circumstances**:
   - SRE team structures evolve based on business needs, requiring periodic reassessment and realignment.

4. **Running Cohesive Distributed Teams**:
   - Strategies like rotating responsibilities and maintaining frequent communication prevent silos and maintain team cohesion.

#### **Ending the Relationship**
1. **Case Study 1: Ares**:
   - The Abuse SRE team disengaged from supporting the Common Abuse Tool (CAT) after empowering CAT developers with the necessary infrastructure and skills. This transition improved developer velocity while maintaining reliability.

2. **Case Study 2: Data Analysis Pipeline**:
   - SRE disengaged after the pipeline team took full ownership of the old system, allowing resources to focus on a next-generation replacement.

#### **Conclusion**
The SRE engagement model highlights the importance of structured collaboration, clear goals, and adaptability. By focusing on shared objectives and continuous improvement, SREs maximize reliability and enable rapid development.
